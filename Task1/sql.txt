The SQL query will be 

SELECT Departments.Department, AVG(Saleries.AMT) AS AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY (USD)
FROM Departments 
JOIN Employees ON Departments.ID = Employees.DEPT_ID
JOIN Salaries ON Employees.EMP_ID = Salaries.EMP_ID
GROUP BY Departments.Department
ORDER BY AVG_MONTHLY_SALARY DESC
LIMIT 3;


So here we have three databases Departments, Employees, Salaries  
the schema looks like  Departments = department id, name of the department
Employees = employee id, name, dept id
salaries  = employee id, month, amount 

first, we have to select which output we need here we select the department name and avg amount. after that, we need to join the tables
by using the join keyword. we need common property to join both tables so in the first table we have Departments.ID = Employees.DEPT_ID 
and in another table we have Employees.EMP_ID = Salaries.EMP_ID now all table is connected. now we need a group table on the basis of departments
for that we are using group key word here, we need output in descending order. at last need, only the top three depts so need to use the LIMIT keyword here.
